Since the game is in fairly early development and I haven't really learned how to use godot 4... it will take some time to download the game. However, there are advantages to everything. After these steps, you can edit the project for yourself! First, you must have windows, since I created the game for such a PC, and second, you must have the godot 4 game engine installed. If you don't have it, you can install it from the official website or maybe somewhere else... I definitely saw it in steam..., The third is to download a folder from my project using the code button, and then the download zip file button, The fourth is to use the import to godot 4 button and take this folder, after which you can launch the game using the run button or edit using... Well, you know which button, have a good game!
